Q1) Explain the difference between IS-A and Has-A relationship with the help of an
example and explain about access modifiers and their accessibility?


IS-A relationship occurs between parent and a child class(inheritance) whereas 
Has-A relation occurs when an object of a class is an instance variable 
of another class.

A HAS-A relationship is dynamic (run time) binding 
while inheritance is a static (compile time) binding.

eg. IS-A relationship

class Vehicle {

}

class Car extends Vehicle {			//Car is a Vehicle

}

class Bike extends Vehicle { 		//Bike is a Vehicle

}

class Truck extends Vehicle {		//Truck is a Vehicle

}

eg HAS-A relationship

class Engine {

}

class PowerBreak {

}

class Turbo {

}

class Car {
	Engine engine = new Engine();		//Car has an Engine
	PowerBreak break = new PowerBreak();		//Car has PowerBreak;
	Turbo turbo = new Turbo();		//Car has Turbo;
}


Access modifiers represents the accessibility(visibility) of member classes, variables, methods etc outside the class and outside the package.

public - accessible everywhere
private  - accessible only in the same class
protected - public inside the package but can be accessed outside the package through child class
default - accessible inside the same package only. If you don't specify access modifier, it will be default.

the outer classes can have public or default access modifiers only.
